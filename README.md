This project code located in the GIS Workbook folder uses Agent Based Modelling to explore sheep behaviour in an environment. The agents are created and given its attributes in the "agentframework.py" file.
The environment created in the "environ.py" file. This is a raster file with pixel values. The "Model_Based_Agents.py" file also the agents to be read into the environment. Here we us Object-Oriented Programming
which allows multiple instruction to be run simulaneously. 

The model is run through "Model_Based_Agent.py" file. 

The project contains runs a number of iterations: 500
Contins 2 major Agents: 
20 agents (Sheep) - They move, eat, store, share and store excess eaten into their environment.
& 2 wolves. 
The wolves - move (Chase sheep) and kill sheep when they are close enough.
